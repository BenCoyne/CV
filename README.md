## Ben Coyne

An inquizitive musician turned full-stack junior web developer. Though my route into the tech sector is far from traditional, my love of creativity, team work and a keen attention to detail are well suited to many of the daily challenges in this exciting field. I am fascinated by the ability tech has to cross industry.

I recently completed a 16-week bootcamp at Makers Academy and I look forward to further developing the fundemental skills and best practices in software engineering that I gained throughout the course.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Phaser 3, Python

## Work Experience

**Folkies Music** (2012-2016)

- Providing excellent customer service whilst selling a variety of high-end instruments, musical accessories and books. This job role required an extensive knowledge of musical equipment as well as the skills to clearly demonstrate a wide range of products.

**Freelance Musician** (2010-present) 

- Being a freelance musician requires vast amounts of drive and resiliance. Though it is vital to master your instrument(s) and creativity skills, arguably it is equally important to develop an ability to think on your feet and react to last minute chanegs, to learn quickly and to seemlessly enter a group dynamic and be ready to not only contribute, but listen and adapt.
