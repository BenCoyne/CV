## Ben Coyne

An inquizitive former musician turned full-stack junior web developer. Though my route into the tech sector is far from traditional, my passion for creativity, team work and  a keen attention to detail are well suited to many of the daily challenges in this exciting field. I am passionate about the ability tech has to cross industry, particularly the intersection between music and coding. 

I am recently started a 16-week bootcamp at Makers Academy where I look forward to further developing the fundemental skills and best practices in software engineering.
